                         <p class="content"><span class="fancy">My journey</span> and exploration with photography began early in my life. As a young child, I was fascinated by photography.
                         I lived in a home filled with strong visual appreciation for family, animals and nature. Photographic moments capturing
                         remarkable expressions and transformations were highlights of my childhood.</p>
                         <p class="content">I spent numerous summers in Muskoka and The Kawartha’s cultivating an incredible appreciation for beauty in all things
                         nature. Being fortunate enough to photograph many diverse landscapes and natural settings with ever changing light in
                         all seasons and travelling to places near and far is my greatest passion. There is no bigger sense of accomplishment
                         than bringing those moments home to share with others – this is a great reward.</p>
                         <p class="content">Surprisingly, I was fascinated by my subjects and the captured moments, and much less interested in the photographer
                         and their credentials. I would find myself as a young teenager wondering how the photographer had planned, sensed,
                         desired and experienced the moment, to capture the shot. I suppose I wanted to experience that precise moment more, but
                         from behind the camera. I would imagine looking through the lens at a subject that radiated beauty and seizing that
                         experience forever in a photograph.</p>
                         <p class="content">Sharing photographic moments of time matters to me. I want to share the beauty of those moments with the world. The
                         true art of transformation, the beauty of change in our surroundings. The moments we don’t anticipate experiencing and
                         those that bring us direct happiness.</p>
                         <p class="content">As a professional photographer, I am driven to capture animals’ unique spirit, nature’s incredible transformation and
                         powerful human emotions. My childhood nickname was “Katfish”. I have always adored water and that attraction extends to
                         all forms – rain, snow, dew, lakes, rivers, oceans. I find water’s substance provides reflection, opacity and clarity.
                         Water demonstrates a range of emotion in my photography, from calmness to crisis.</p>
                                        <blockquote class="content">
                                             <p class="quote"> My success I treat as a gift. I did not aspire to be famous photographer, I only wanted to impact people through my
                                             lens. It’s not about me, it’s about the photo. When people buy my photography, they are bringing the emotional beauty
                                             of change into their homes or offices. Everyday they can experience the moment of joy I felt when I took the photo and
                                             that makes me feel great</p>
                                        </blockquote> 
                         <p class="content">Stunning transformation is everywhere and in everything. As a young person, I resisted change. I find it so ironic over
                         time, I began to see the beauty in change through my lens, making change the core of my craft. I thoroughly enjoy
                         giving people the beauty of change through my camera.</p>
